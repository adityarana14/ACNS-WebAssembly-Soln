    <p>The 23rd International Conference on Applied Cryptography and Network Security (ACNS @Data.Year) will be held in @Data.Location, on @Data.Dates. ACNS is an annual conference focusing on current developments that advance the areas of applied cryptography, cyber security (including network and computer security), and privacy. The goal is to present both academic research works and advances on industrial and technical frontiers.</p>

    <p>Submissions may focus on the modeling, design, analysis, development, deployment, integration, maintenance performance, and usability of algorithms, protocols, standards, implementations, devices, as well as systems, standing in relation with applied cryptography, cyber security and privacy and advancing or bringing new insights to the state of the art.</p>

    <h4 class="text-center">Areas of Interest (partial list)</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Applied cryptography</li>
        <li>Artificial intelligence for security</li>
        <li>Authentication and biometric security and privacy</li>
        <li>Blockchain security and privacy</li>
        <li>Cloud security and privacy</li>
        <li>Post-quantum cryptography</li>
        <li>Usable security and privacy</li>
        <li>And many more...</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Besides the main conference, ACNS also seeks workshop proposals. Each satellite workshop will provide a forum to address a specific topic at the forefront of cybersecurity research. Papers accepted at the workshops will have post-proceedings published by Springer in the LNCS series as well.</p>
